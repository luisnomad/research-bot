# Personal Knowledge Base

AI-powered knowledge management system.

## Structure

- `sources/` - Processed bookmarks from Raindrop
- `topics/` - Topic clusters discovered by AI
- `syntheses/` - AI-generated articles and summaries
- `drafts/` - Content ready for publishing
- `journal/` - Daily notes
- `archive/` - Deprecated content

## Workflow

1. Bookmark interesting content in Raindrop
2. AI processes and extracts to `sources/`
3. AI cross-references and creates `topics/`
4. Weekly synthesis generates summaries
5. Publish-ready content moves to `drafts/`
