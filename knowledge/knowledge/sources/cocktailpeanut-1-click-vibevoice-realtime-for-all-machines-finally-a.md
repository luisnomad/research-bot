# 1-Click Vibevoice-Realtime for ALL machines

Finally a Realtime TTS that is ACTU

### Part 1

1-Click Vibevoice-Realtime for ALL machines

Finally a Realtime TTS that is ACTUALLY realtime, thanks to its tiny size! (0.5B params)

This video is from my Windows machine, recorded in realtime. All you need is around 2.5GB VRAM, it even works on Macs!

---

### Part 2

Run it on your local PC with 1-click, available via 
http://
pinokio.co

---

### Part 3

Fun fact --- This 1-click launcher was 100% built by AI in Pinokio!



---

### Part 4

Official Github from Microsoft:

---

### Part 5

The launcher automatically:

1. Downloads the new VibeVoice-Realtime-0.5B model from Huggingface 
https://
huggingface.co/microsoft/Vibe
Voice-Realtime-0.5B
…
2. Sets up environment.
3. And launches the app, all with one click.

### Part 6

Just a quick note: It's not perfect yet. You may notice a slight choppiness as it starts speaking. I would like to think that it's not the model's problem but just this specific code implementation (The official github code), hopefully this becomes smoother.
