# The agent experience in 
@code
 just got a major upgrade.

With today's release,

### Part 1

The agent experience in 
@code
 just got a major upgrade.

With today's release, you'll see:
 Agent sessions integrated into the chat view for a unified experience
 Support for isolated background agents powered by Git worktrees
 Seamless delegation across agents



---

### Part 2

Agent sessions are now integrated directly into the Chat view.

See session status, progress, and file changes at a glance. Archive sessions to stay organized. Select any session to view the full conversation history.

---

### Part 3

Background agents work in their own isolated workspaces, so you can run multiple background agents without conflicts.

Git worktree support isolates each agent's changes in a separate folder. Review and merge changes back when done - or apply directly to your workspace.

---

### Part 4

Hand off tasks seamlessly across agents.

Start brainstorming locally, then continue with a background or cloud agent using "Continue in". 

Your chat context transfers automatically and the original session archives after handoff.

---

### Part 5

Seamless agent collaboration in VS Code, tailored to the way you work best.
