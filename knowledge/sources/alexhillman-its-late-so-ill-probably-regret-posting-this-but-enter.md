### Part 1

its late so i'll probably regret posting this but...

enter the dragon 

say hi to Smaug, the helpful hoarding dragon that roams your Twitter bookmarks and helps you organize them into your personal knowledge system of choice.

special thanks to 
@steipete
, this would be a lot messier without his work!

### Part 2

Smaug is the most useful parts of my very custom system, built to bridge your Twitter bookmarks with your favorite knowledge system (Obsidian, etc) with a simple and reliable agentic personal assistant who...happens to act like a dragon.

### Part 3

Run it manually a few times to learn how it works, then set it up to run as often as you want (instructions in the readme). 

~20 bookmarks typically takes it ~5-7 minutes depending on how many links they contain and what's inside them. 

have fun, PRs welcome!
