# You can now use Claude as an orchestration agent for long-form video generation.

### Part 1

You can now use Claude as an orchestration agent for long-form video generation.

From one text prompt, it can direct various tools and combine outputs - like Nano Banana Pro for images, Hailuo 2 for video, and ffmpeg to stitch.

Watch it construct my bookstore x coffee shop

### Part 2

The easiest way to do this is with the new

 agents. 

It comes pre-loaded with skills that Claude knows how to use to orchestrate long-form video generation. 

This one is particularly great a room renovations - would suggest trying it out!
