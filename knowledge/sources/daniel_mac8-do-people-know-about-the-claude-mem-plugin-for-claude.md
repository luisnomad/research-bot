# Do people know about the "claude-mem" plugin for Claude Code?

Gives Opus 4.5 in

### Part 1

Do people know about the "claude-mem" plugin for Claude Code?

Gives Opus 4.5 in Claude Code memory. Tracks your project details locally using an LLM so CC can reference them later.

There is even an open PR to merge the Titans memory framework from GDM.

Really excellent.
