# Successfully running Ultralytics YOLOv8 on a Jetson Nano with an IMX219 camera.

### Part 1

Successfully running Ultralytics YOLOv8 on a Jetson Nano with an IMX219 camera.
Real-time vision on the edge.

### Part 2

Using a USB camera like Logitech C270 is much easier than the IMX219 camera.
For YOLOv8 with TensorRT
IMX219: more setup pain, higher FPS (~30)
USB C270: plug-and-play, but ~10 FPS
