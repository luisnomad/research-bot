# Generated some futuristic stuff with Nano Banana and converted them to 3D using

### Part 1

Generated some futuristic stuff with Nano Banana and converted them to 3D using Tencent's Hunyuan3D.

The results are genuinely impressive, and these are all first generations with zero retries.

Quick review ↓

### Part 2

Here are the images I generated with Nano Banana that were used as input for these 3D models.

### Part 3

From my testing, the best image to 3D models right now are Tencent's Hunyuan3D and Microsoft TRELLIS.2. Both are open source.

TRELLIS.2

You can run them locally or on Colab, and there are also paid services that offer

### Part 4

In most cases, Hunyuan3D produces better results than TRELLIS.2.
With default settings, Hunyuan3D outputs are around 40 MB, while TRELLIS.2 outputs are closer to 20 MB.

The meshes can be optimized to reduce size, but for quick prototyping these file sizes are totally fine.

---

### Part 5

Both Hunyuan3D and TRELLIS.2 generate a single mesh. This means you cannot animate individual parts without manually separating them in software like Blender.

Tencent also offers Hunyuan3D-Part, which performs mesh segmentation. However, it removes textures in the process.

### Part 6

Neither model is particularly good at generating readable text on objects.
If you are using this in a web app, you will likely need something like DecalGeometry from three.js for text and labels.

---

### Part 7

These models can be useful for a wide range of use cases.
Even if you still prefer fully optimized Blender models, using generated meshes as references can save a significant amount of time.

---

### Part 8

As mentioned in a previous post, these tools can also be useful in scientific research.
For example, reconstructing skeletons, ancient buildings, or artifacts from images.

---

### Part 9

Beyond digital environments, these models can also be used for 3D printing workflows.
