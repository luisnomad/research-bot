### Part 1

STOP everything you're doing, and go try WebGPU and TSL.

I wanted to give a shot to TSL and see how it's working today, and wow.

in short, it's great


@sea3dformat
, 
@mrdoob
  and all the TSL contributors made an awesome job making it as easy as possible

#threejsjourney #r3f #threejs

details below

### Part 2

I stopped everything I was working on to make a short TSL experiment

I made a mistake when I first approached TSL, and WebGPU.

I thought the paradigm is the same, vertexShader, fragmentShader.

But it's not, at all, it's a node approach.

Let's talk about the heat distortion

### Part 3

But WebGPU has access to those data directly, and TSL isn't just a shading language, it's a GPU compute language, a way for you to communicate with the GPU directly and simply.

you can compute shaders but also do much more 

screenUV, viewportSharedTexture is directly accessible

### Part 4

and adding your effect on a BackdropNode allow you to affect directly what's happening behind your 3D object.

---

### Part 5

Only issues, is that as of today compatibility with React-three/fiber and React-three/drei with React19 and WebGPU is a bit of a mess and you might encounter some issues.

I think aside from work I will let GLSL down now and create some gaming tools for TSL WebGPU

### Part 6

The Rafale is a one draw call rigged Rafale
