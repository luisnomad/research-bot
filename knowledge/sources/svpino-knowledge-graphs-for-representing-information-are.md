Knowledge graphs for representing information are unbeatable.

After this, you will never build a RAG system without knowledge graphs.

It will take you five lines of code to build a knowledge graph with your data.

I recorded a video to show you how you can do this.

I used Cognee, an open-source library that outperforms any basic vector search approach in terms of retrieval relevance. They are collaborating with me on this post.

Cognee is:

• Easy to use
• Reduces hallucinations
• Open-source

Here is a link to the repository:

They also offer a comprehensive platform and UI with Python notebooks you can utilize to manage your data. Here is the link:
