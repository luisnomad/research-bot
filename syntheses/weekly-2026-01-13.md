# Weekly Knowledge Synthesis - Week 2, 2026

## 🔥 Hot Topics This Week

### 1. AI Agents in Production (15 bookmarks)
The community is moving from "agent demos" to "agent deployments". Major focus on:
- Error recovery patterns
- Tool orchestration
- Cost optimization

**Key insight**: Everyone is struggling with the same problems - context management and reliability.

**Related**: [[llm-context-management]], [[production-ai-systems]]

### 2. Playwright Test Migration (8 bookmarks)
Lots of content about Cypress → Playwright migrations. Common pain points:
- Selector strategies differ significantly  
- Async/await patterns need rework
- Test parallelization is easier but requires restructuring

**Actionable**: Your migration at work could become a blog series.

### 3. Local LLM Optimization (12 bookmarks)
New quantization methods, Metal performance optimizations for M-series chips.

**Watch**: llama.cpp just got 40% faster on M4

## 📊 Trend Analysis

**Rising**: 
- Multi-agent systems
- AI testing frameworks
- Vector database optimization

**Declining**:
- Generic "ChatGPT wrapper" content
- "AGI is coming" hype posts

## 💡 Content Opportunities

### High-Impact LinkedIn Posts
1. "I migrated 500 Cypress tests to Playwright. Here's what I wish I knew" (personal experience)
2. "Why your AI agent fails in production (and how to fix it)" (synthesis of learnings)
3. "Running Llama 3.3 70B on M4 Mac Mini - Full Breakdown" (technical deep dive)

### Technical Blog Posts
- "The Playwright Migration Playbook: Lessons from Real Projects"
- "Building a Local AI Knowledge Base with Ollama and Raindrop"
